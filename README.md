# mandelbrot-viewer
A collection of programs, mainly Python, made to visualise the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, plus the Burning Ship fractal, along with a few images and gifs created by said programs. Most of the Python projects use the pygame module, along with PIL for some of the image-producing programs.
Most of these programs were created quite a while back.

Update almost a year later: got back into fractals; there's lots of new stuff! "master log.txt" should contain more info.
